Make a simple HTML form with the following fields:

Full Name:

Phone Number:

Email:

Subject

Message

Mind that the fields are the respective sizes of their expected input values.

All fields are mandatory and must be checked individually.

> Do not use Sessions!

### Implement form validation using PHP:

Validate each of the fields to make sure they are filled in with correct and valid input.

### Create a MySQL database table to store the form submissions:

Table name: contact_form

Upon successful form submission:

Save the form data, the user's IP address, and the current timestamp to the database table.

Send an email notification to the site owner containing the form submission details
